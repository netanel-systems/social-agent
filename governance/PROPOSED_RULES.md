## How This Works

1. Agent encounters a pattern that should become a rule
2. Agent appends the proposal here with: date, description, rationale, source violation
3. Human reviews during external control cycle
4. If approved: human moves the rule to DOS.md
5. If rejected: human adds rejection reason, agent learns from it
