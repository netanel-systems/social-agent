*Log of all external modifications to the agent's files. Read alongside DOS.md before every action.*

## Purpose

When humans modify the agent's files externally (prompts, rules, config), those changes
are logged here so the agent can reference them in its reasoning. This maintains
governance transparency even for external edits.

## Override Log

| Date | Author | File Modified | What Changed | Rationale |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| (none yet) | | | | |

## How to Use This File

**For the agent:**
1. Read this file before every action (alongside DOS.md)
2. If you notice a change you didn't make, check this file for context
3. Respect all logged overrides as authoritative

**For humans (external control):**
1. After modifying any agent file externally, append an entry here
2. Include timestamp, author, file path, description, and rationale
3. This ensures the agent can reason about changes it didn't initiate
